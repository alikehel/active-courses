- Watch: https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-scientists-tools/getting-help-dhpW3
- Read:  https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
- Read: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-ask-good-technical-questions/
- Read about XY Problem: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
- Ask a binary question if possible. (I.e., True/false)
- If not, Ask enclosed question if possible. (I.e., question that has expected answer; E.g., Which color? "Red", "Green", "Blue")
- If not, ask open quesion and supply atomic information in an enumerated form. (E.g., "How to study Algorithms?" 1. I know math. 2. I know Programming Languages.)
- Before contacting Mentors, check how to communicate: ⁠mfaq
